# DevSkits Landing Page

This repository hosts a single-page contact and links hub for DevSkits that is ready to serve from GitHub Pages.

## Running locally
Open `index.html` in your browser or serve the folder with any static server (for example, `python -m http.server 8000`).

## Deploying to GitHub Pages
1. Push `index.html` (and this `README.md`) to the `main` branch of your GitHub repository.
2. In **Settings → Pages**, select **Deploy from a branch** with the `main` branch and `/ (root)` folder.
3. Save. GitHub Pages will publish the site at `https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo-name>/`.

No build steps, external assets, or dependencies are required.
